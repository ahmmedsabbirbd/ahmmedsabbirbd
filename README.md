### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## Sabbir Ahmmed

I'm a passionate and self-motivated programmer with a deep understanding of OOP, PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript. With over three years of hands-on experience in Front-End Design for web templates and applications, I specialize in turning ideas into reality. If you need anything on the frontend, I can bring it to life using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (where technically feasible).

I have 1+ years of experience in the Laravel framework, enabling me to develop secure, efficient, and scalable applications with clean, well-documented code.

I excel in WordPress plugin development, crafting custom solutions to enhance functionality and user experience.

Beyond development, I transform innovative ideas into fully functional applications in PHP, MySQL, and JavaScriptâ€”provided they are validatedâ€”leveraging both my professional expertise and institutional knowledge.
